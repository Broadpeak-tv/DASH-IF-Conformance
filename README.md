# HLS

This repository is a submodule of the [Integrated Conformance Software Tool](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/IntegratedConformance) and contains support for HLS manifest processing. It has been created to maintain and manage the HLS-related features, such as m3u8 parsing and segment URLs derivation. This block is called whenever the provided manifest file is HLS m3u8.
